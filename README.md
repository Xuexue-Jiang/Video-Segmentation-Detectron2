This is a Video Segmentation project using PyTorch and the Meta Detectron2 library which provides state-of-the-art detection and segmentation algorithms.

For more details on Meta computer vision AI research, see https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2

The implementation uses the Detectron2 library to segment person/people appearing in any videos. 

However, it can also be used to segment other object with which lables are provided within the COCO dataset object categories. 

For more details on the COCO dataset that are used in this segmentation. See https://cocodataset.org/#home  &&  https://opencv.org/introduction-to-the-coco-dataset/
